# RHS Slippers

The premier place to get your lobster slippers.

## Accessing the Website

Here are your options to view the website in order of most ideal to okay.

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

You can view the website at [https://rhs-slippers.vercel.app](https://rhs-slippers.vercel.app).

### Option 2: Development Build

Install the newest version of node js found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

With `npm` (built into node) installed, run:

```bash
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

Then you can access the website at `http://localhost:3000`. The pages will initially build as you navigate them, so it might be a bit slow.
If the landing page doesnt look correct at first, reload the page and it should show up (this means that the page was still building).


## Source Code
All the source code for the website can be found in this repo, and is primarily in src/.
